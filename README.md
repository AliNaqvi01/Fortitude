# üõ°Ô∏è Fortitude for Android ‚öîÔ∏è 


Track your Fortnite Stats easily and quickly with Fortitude. 
No ads, no BS, just the stats that you care about and an intuitive interface. 
Simply enter your username and choose the platform you play on, Fortitude takes care of the rest.

Built using Java. The TRN stat api is called via Android Volley and presented in a clean and beautiful listView interface. Additional libraries have been implemented aswell, inluding libraries to revise the Toast, add an info page, and revise the text box.

This project is my first dive into software development. It serves as an exercise of UI design, third party APIs and HTTP requests, JSON parsing, data persistence etc.
